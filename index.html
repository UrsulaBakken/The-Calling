    <p> [Verse 1: Madeleine Hyland] <br><br>
    Back then I was dauntless
    And dawn could never know
    And my weakness made me weep less
    Than I would ever show you
    I’d burn so bright it blinded
    Now I know that light guided me here</p>
    </figure>
    
    <figure>
    
    <p>[Verse 2: Madeleine Hyland] <br><br>
    I walked into the river
    To wring those embers from my broken heart and broken liver
    You’ll never get your dinner if you don’t learn how to get along
    And a fox somewhere is hiding
    That light I thought was blinding brought me here</p>

    </figure>

    <figure> <p>[Pre-Chorus: Madeleine Hyland & (Joey Batey)] <br><br>
    I look into the waters
    And see a face I don’t understand
    Wе’re both unwanted daughters
    But thеre’s more than water in these autumn hands
    I look into the waters and see a face I don’t recognise
    Who’s this
    (Who are you)
    What changed I ask
    So strange, she replies</p></figure>
    
   
    <figure> <p>[Chorus] <br><br>
    [Madeleine Hyland] <br>
    Shoulder the sky
    Open those eyes
    There’s a kind of calling
    Calling</p></figure> 
    
    <figure>  
    <p>[Joey Batey] <br>
    I can’t wait to show you
    How much I know you can be
    Just let the rain come
    Let the rain come down, down, darling
    Can’t you hear it howling you
    It’s calling, calling</p>

    <figure> <p>[Verse 3: Madeleine Hyland] <br> <br>
    Back then I wasn’t hopeful
    But now my ink’s blood red not black
    And I’ll blink like ripping envelopes
    In the hopes that you’ll write back
    And on the banks of that river
    I shiver as a fox stands frozen
    And I close them, I close them, I close my eyes</p></figure>
    
    <figure> <p>[Verse 4: Madeleine Hyland] <br><br>
    ‘Cos I’m between that just one more and drank too much again
    And I promise you I’ll write I love you
    With my fingers on your sleeping hand
    And when that fox howls I’ll howl with it
    In its cries I’ll find an end
    And when I think I’m fine you’ll visit
    And then you happen to me, you happen to me all over again</p></figure>  
    
    <figure>   <p>[Pre-Chorus: Madeleine Hyland] <br><br>
    In the waters I see a face I don’t want look back
    Do you like my dress, it’s got pockets
    The rocks beneath my feet begin to crack</p></figure>
    
    <figure><p>Oh I look into the waters
    Long ago that current caught us and we tried
    I tried I really fucking tried
    But the rain kept coming down
    I watch that woman drown</p></figure>
  
    <figure>  <p>[4x Chorus] <br> <br>
    [Madeleine Hyland] <br><br>
    Shoulder the sky
    Open those eyes
    There’s a kind of calling
    Calling</p></figure>
   
      
   <figure> <p>I can’t wait to show you
    How much I know you can be
    Just let the rain come
    Let the rain come down, down, darling
    Can’t you hear it howling you
    It’s calling, calling</p><p>[3x Choir & 1x Joey Batey] <br> <br></figure>
